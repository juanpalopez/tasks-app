This is an app created using express with Handlebars as template engine, and Bootstrap for styling.

So far the app is working, you can create a todo list with a local mongo DB.

# Next Features:

- I would be working a creating a cloud DB, so anyone can use the app.
- Also and creating users management section, so that each user can have a private list. (Right there is only one list).
- I will create an API on top the mongodb
- I will add React for the frontend.

Right now you can clone it and use it:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/juanpalopez/tasks-app.git
cd tasks-app
# Install node modules
npm install
# Run App
npm run start
# Or you can also run it in dev mode (this will use nodemon to update changes)
npm run devstart
```
